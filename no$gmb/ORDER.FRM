Hehoo! This is an ORDER FORM! Messed around in old shareware software, and
found an order form included in one of the programs, cool, not sure if these
things are still popular, but now I want to make a form, too. So here it is:

PRINT THE FORM BELOW ON PAPER, FILL OUT THE QUESTIONS, AND SEND IT TO:
OR, FOR BETTER LEGIBILTY, FIRST FILL IT OUT, THEN PRINT AND SEND IT TO:
OR, IF YOU DON'T LIKE FORMS / DON'T HAVE A PRINTER, FORGET ABOUT IT AND
SEND A NORMAL LETTER INSTEAD TO:

  Martin Korth
  Ringheide 44
  21149 Hamburg
  Germany

About the money/amount. You can send how much you like (for non-commercial
registration), if possible at least $5 US. And YES, beside for US$ you can
ALSO send Canadian dollars, Brazilian R$, Francs, Peseta, Yen, Rubel, Marks,
Crowns, Lira, etc...
If you need more info, read the help text in the emulator, otherwise just
go ahead and put it into mail!

I basically understand what the expression "emulator" means, I am aware that
no$gmb is an emulator and not a game, I realize that no games are included
with no$gmb, and I know that emulators and games are different things.
